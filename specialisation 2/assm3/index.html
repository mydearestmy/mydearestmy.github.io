        <h2>Design guiding values and how they were embodied in the UI</h2>
        <p>
          Orbital Sound is guided by three core values: immersion, clarity, and
          rewarding feedback.

          <strong>Immersion</strong> comes from the visual and auditory
          environment: the glowing planet, drifting particles, soft gradient
          background, and starry sky create a calming sense of depth and space,
          helping users feel part of a small physical system.

          <strong>Clarity</strong> is expressed through simplicity: a single
          planet and draggable moon immediately communicate the interaction. The
          consistent mapping of colours to sounds also supports understanding
          and predictability.

          <strong>Rewarding feedback</strong> is built into both visuals and
          sound: dragging the moon produces immediate sonic responses and subtle
          motion effects, while hover states and trails reinforce interaction,
          giving users a satisfying sense of control. Together, these design
          choices turn abstract values into tangible interface behaviour, making
          the UI both engaging and approachable.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Rationale in designing feedback, information design, mapping, and
          learnability
        </h2>
        <p>
          Feedback and mapping were central to the interface’s clarity and
          learnability. The moon’s behaviour is straightforward: dragging it
          changes the sound, and its stereo pan reflects its orbital angle. This
          direct cause-and-effect mapping helps users understand the system
          quickly and builds confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Colour serves as a visual cue linked to sound: each of the seven hues
          corresponds to a specific waveform and frequency. This predictable
          mapping makes the system easier to learn and remember. Additional
          cues, like hover effects and a tooltip, reinforce feedback without
          cluttering the interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          These choices directly reflect my design values: clarity drives
          simplicity, immersion comes from the seamless interaction of visuals
          and audio, and rewarding feedback is achieved by making each action
          feel meaningful and responsive. Technical constraints, such as working
          in 2D rather than 3D, also encouraged me to focus on clear, tangible
          mappings.
        </p>
        <h2>Significant changes since the work-in-progress milestone</h2>
        <p>
          Since the work-in-progress milestone, I made several important
          updates. Previously, the moon’s colour and sound were randomised,
          which made the interface unpredictable. I linked them
          deterministically so each colour now consistently produces the same
          sound. Visually, the planet now appears to spin via a gradient
          animation, the moon glows and becomes magnetically attracted to the
          cursor on hover, and the background is now a starry sky, strengthening
          the sense of space. I also added a reset button, polished the moon’s
          trail animation, and smoothed the planet’s gradient transitions.
          Together, these improvements made the interface more immersive,
          cohesive, and responsive.
        </p>

        <h2>Navigation of the production timeline</h2>
        <p>
          I spent a lot of time early on prototyping the audio logic and
          troubleshooting Web Audio quirks, which delayed the visual polish. I
          had originally planned to develop visuals and audio concurrently, but
          technical challenges forced a divergence in the schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key turning point was the planet’s gradient animation. I
          underestimated how complex it would be to loop seamlessly, testing
          multiple approaches before realising the gradient itself needed to be
          tileable. While this took longer than expected, it produced a smooth,
          polished visual effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this project taught me to adapt my plans when challenges
          arise. By focusing first on the core interaction and iteratively
          refining visuals, I maintained scope while delivering a cohesive and
          functional UI. It reinforced the importance of prioritising essential
          elements in self-directed work, while leaving room for refinement.
        </p>

        <h2>Design aspect i’m most proud of</h2>
        <p>
          I’m most proud of the planet’s gradient animation. Since the interface
          is 2D, I couldn’t spin the planet literally, so I created a shifting
          gradient to give the illusion of rotation. This subtle effect brings
          the scene to life, conveys a sense of orbit, and unites the visual and
          auditory elements. It shows how simple visual techniques can create a
          compelling sense of motion and depth without needing complex 3D
          models.
        </p>

        <h2>Design aspect i found most challenging</h2>
        <p>
          Initially, I tried to import a 3D model using Three.js to make the
          planet rotate, but I couldn’t get the library to work correctly. As a
          result, I shifted to a 2D approach and implemented the gradient
          animation instead. Even then, creating a seamless illusion of motion
          was challenging — I tested linear gradients, background-position
          tricks, and repeating patterns before realising the gradient itself
          had to be tileable. This process taught me a lot about CSS animation,
          visual continuity, and adapting complex ideas into simpler, functional
          solutions.
