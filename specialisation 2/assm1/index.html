      <h1>Interaction Design Analysis – 7 Poems and Liquid Entropy</h1>
      <p>
        Both <strong>7 Poems</strong> and <strong>Liquid Entropy</strong> are
        interactive poetry websites, but they approach interaction design in
        completely different ways. <strong>7 Poems</strong> is quiet and
        structured, while <strong>Liquid Entropy</strong> feels more abstract
        and unpredictable. They both play with how a user navigates,
        experiences, and interprets poetry, but the mood, tone, and even how
        control is given (or taken) from the user sets them apart. <br /><br />
        Below is a comparison of the two across four key principles:
        <em>information design</em>, <em>mapping</em>,
        <em>characterisation</em>, and <em>feedback</em>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="information">
      <h1>Information Design</h1>
      <p>
        7 Poems adopts a minimal and spatial layout — a yellow background dotted
        with seven titled boxes. Each title represents a poem, and when idle,
        the design holds silence and stillness. Once hovered, a subtle shadow
        suggests interactivity, and upon activation, the box animates a poem
        word by word, accompanied by ambient sound. Information unfolds over
        time — slow, poetic, deliberate. The focus is on pacing and emotional
        tone, not efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, Liquid Entropy opens with a sensory overload: glitch
        effects, reactive visuals, and an absence of clear navigation. The
        interface is ambiguous — the information design asks users to explore
        rather than read. It avoids hierarchy in favor of immersion. While
        confusing at first, it aligns with a high-concept audiovisual art
        experience where legibility is secondary to mood.
      </p>
      <p>
        This contrast shows two extremes of information delivery: 7 Poems gently
        guides the reader to focus on a single idea at a time, while Liquid
        Entropy rewards those who are willing to decode its structure through
        exploration. One is time-based clarity; the other is aesthetic
        complexity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mapping">
      <h1>Mapping</h1>
      <p>
        In 7 Poems, mapping is direct and literal. Each of the seven boxes
        corresponds to a specific poem, and clicking a box triggers its unique
        word-by-word animation and sound. This spatial layout — evenly
        distributed boxes on a uniform background — creates a clean visual
        metaphor: each square is a doorway into a self-contained poem. There's
        no confusion about where to go or what to expect — interaction is calm
        and linear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liquid Entropy, on the other hand, abandons conventional mapping. There
        are no obvious buttons or navigational cues. Instead, clicking,
        dragging, or hovering at different points may trigger sound, animation,
        or transitions — but never predictably. This ambiguity forces the user
        to "learn" the interface by experimenting. It's disorienting but
        intentionally so — the site mimics a feeling of entropy through its lack
        of fixed input-output logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two designs show a philosophical divide. 7 Poems is about clarity
        and focus — every input has a stable output. Liquid Entropy is about
        instability, where control feels temporary and earned. This difference
        affects how users navigate and how much they feel “in control.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="characterisation">
      <h1>Characterisation</h1>
      <p>
        7 Poems uses interaction as a characterising tool. The site feels
        delicate, intimate, and respectful of the poem format. The slow
        appearance of words and the soft ambient sounds create a meditative
        experience. The interface doesn’t want to compete with the poem — it
        wants to support it. The green color change on click feels like a gentle
        signal: you’ve paused the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liquid Entropy, by contrast, has a strong personality that dominates the
        experience. It’s glitchy, layered, chaotic — the interface itself feels
        like a living being. It demands attention, constantly moves, and offers
        no stable resting point. The user is never just a reader — they’re an
        intruder or participant in a machine-like environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where 7 Poems acts like a quiet room in a gallery, Liquid Entropy is
        more like an underground club with no signs. Both sites reflect their
        subject matter — poetry vs digital abstraction — but they also frame the
        user very differently. One invites contemplation; the other insists on
        reaction.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="feedback">
      <h1>Feedback</h1>
      <p>
        In 7 Poems, feedback is subtle but immediate. Hovering adds a soft
        shadow, letting the user know the boxes are interactive. Clicking causes
        the box to animate, text to appear, and ambient sound to begin.
        Crucially, stopping the interaction — clicking again — halts both the
        animation and the sound. The feedback loop is designed to be emotionally
        sensitive, matching the pace and tone of the poems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Liquid Entropy, feedback is more chaotic. It exists — but not always
        in ways the user expects. Sometimes the background reacts to the mouse.
        Other times, a sound triggers with no clear cause. The feedback loop is
        more artistic than functional — it’s about sensation rather than
        confirmation. There’s a deliberate mismatch between input and response,
        which can be frustrating but is also part of the conceptual play.
      </p>
      <p>
        This contrast reveals different priorities: 7 Poems gives users control
        and reassurance. Liquid Entropy removes control to emphasize disruption.
        Each approach uses feedback not just as utility, but as a form of
        expression.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection">
      <h1>Final Reflection</h1>
      <p>
        These two sites demonstrate how interaction design is never neutral — it
        shapes how users feel, explore, and make meaning. 7 Poems uses clean
        mapping, subtle feedback, and emotional pacing to support quiet, poetic
        reflection. Liquid Entropy distorts those norms, offering a fractured,
        unpredictable journey that leans into discomfort and abstraction. Both
        are carefully crafted — and their choices reflect not only aesthetic
        goals but values about what interaction should do.
