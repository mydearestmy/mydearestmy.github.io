      <div class="answer1">
        The first thing I noticed when I interacted with the website was its
        color palette and the 3D objects floating in the background. The soft
        pastel gradients used in the design created a calm and modern vibe. The
        3D elements, which seemed to gently move or shift as I scrolled, added
        an extra layer of depth to the experience, making it feel dynamic and
        engaging right from the start.

        I spent the most time in the "Studio" section, which showcases Luni’s
        portfolio of apps. This section allowed me to dive deeper into their

        interested in the detailed visuals of each app, which made the
        experience feel both informative and visually stimulating.

      <div class="container11">
        The primary goal of the website is to present Luni as an innovative app
        development company that attracts both potential clients and talent. It
        aims to showcase their portfolio, highlight the creative process behind
        their projects, and invite new employees or collaborators to join their
        team. The goal is clear: communicate the company’s modern, dynamic
        approach to app development and their unique company culture.

      <div class="container13">
        The design and functionality of the website communicate this goal
        effectively through the use of sleek visuals, engaging 3D elements, and
        a user-friendly interface. The portfolio of projects is clearly
        highlighted, showing the diversity of the apps they've created. The
        "Career" section is inviting, and the "Luni Life" page provides insight
        into the company’s culture. This combination of design and content gives
        a clear impression of what Luni is about and what they offer.

        my impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time
      </div>
      <div class="container15">
        My impression is that the website is more suited for occasional visits
        rather than regular, long-term interaction. Since the content doesn't
        change very often, I imagine I would visit it once to explore their
        portfolio and career opportunities, and maybe return periodically to
        check for any updates. It doesn’t seem designed to encourage daily or
        frequent engagement, but rather to provide useful information in an
        engaging way when needed.

        how does the interactive experience communicate this?
      </div>
      <div class="container17">
        The experience suggests that users should engage with it when they have
        a specific need, such as checking out new job opportunities or looking
        at new projects. It doesn't push for frequent visits, but instead
        presents the content in a way that encourages users to check back if
        there are updates. The site is clear and accessible but doesn't have
        built-in mechanisms like progress tracking or personalized content,
        which would typically encourage repeated use.

    <div class="page9">
      <div class="container18">other media forms reference</div>
      <div class="container19">
        The website references a digital aesthetic similar to the clean,
        interactive interfaces often seen in tech startups and app development
        platforms. The use of floating 3D objects and seamless transitions makes
        it feel like a cross between a tech brand’s landing page and an
        interactive digital art installation. There’s also a sense of influence
        from modern advertising styles, with a focus on visuals and brand
        identity.

      <div class="container22">how i should feel</div>
      <div class="container23">
        The clean design and interactive features suggest that I should engage
        with the site in a fluid, exploratory manner. The site doesn’t demand
        long, focused sessions but instead encourages short, exploratory visits
        where I can quickly learn more about the company’s offerings, whether
        that’s checking out their apps, reading about their values, or browsing
        job opportunities.
      </div>
      <div class="container24">
        The reference to modern tech and digital art evokes a sense of
        excitement and curiosity. The floating 3D elements and smooth
        transitions give the impression that I should feel like I'm exploring
        something innovative and forward-thinking. It encourages me to feel
        engaged and interested in the company’s creative work, while also making
        the experience feel enjoyable and visually stimulating.

      <div class="container27">
        One frustrating part of the interaction is that some interactive
        elements aren't immediately intuitive. The design, though visually
        appealing, can feel a bit space-heavy, making it slightly harder to
        access information quickly. Some sections require more effort to
        navigate, especially when trying to jump between different parts of the
        website in a short amount of time.
      </div>
      <div class="container28">
        The most satisfying part of the interaction was the seamless transition
        between sections and the smooth flow of 3D animations. These subtle
        transitions made the entire experience feel fluid and cohesive. The
        interactive elements added a layer of depth that kept me engaged, making
        the experience feel not only functional but also immersive and visually
        captivating.
